# INTRODUCTION

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:
1. STM32F407 Discovery Board
2. Push Button
3. LEDs
4. Resistors
5. Power Supply

# ADVANTAGES:
* To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.
* Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.
* As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.
* It is quite simple to use.
* As a consequence, less energy is consumed.
* Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.
* Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.

# Disadvantages:
* When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.
* The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.
* Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain. 

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)
# WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.
# WHY
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.
#WHEN
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
# WHO
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.
# HOW
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
# WHERE
* In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
