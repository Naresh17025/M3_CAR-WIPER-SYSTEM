The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.
# WHY
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.
#WHEN
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
# WHO
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.
# HOW
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
# WHERE
* In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
